# comments on repro_course_final_report_jason
1. Organization 
  - the repository is easy to navigate, the readme is comprehensive. 
2. Content
  - the text of the report reads well. It tends to cover a lot of territory and therefore does not document everything in detph but this is understandable given the exercise.
  - The project is important with respect to the amount of work put in it, as well as its significance for the field of EEG. 
  - The study of the reporting limitations of the EEG studies is really interesting and the solution proposed (fixing COBIDAS) is both practical and would be efficient.
  - The study of the differences found with the baseline corrections is excellent. The only limitation is that the data are not available, but this is due to factors independent of your work.
3. Code 
  - the code is clear and documented
  - Some paths are still hard coded for instance "/Users/jasondsc/Desktop/neur_602_paper/Raw_data/sample_sizes.csv" 
4. Suggestions
  - with a bit more work this study could be finalized and published for the wider scientific community
  - a few things need to be fixed / expanded in terms of documentation and reproducibility
5. Conclusion
  - this is one of the best project. I really wish that this could be finished.
